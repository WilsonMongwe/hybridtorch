# hybridtorch

PyTorch based library for Hamiltonian and Shadow Hamiltonian Monte Carlo samplers for inference in probabilistic models. This library allows the user to perform inference on user-specified models implemented in PyTorch.

The following samplers are currently in development: 
1. Metropolis-Hastings
2. Locally Scaled Metropolis-Hastings
3. Stochastic Volatility Metropols-Hastings
4. Hamiltonian Monte Carlo
5. Magnetic Hamiltonian Monte Carlo
6. Quantum-Inspired Hamiltonian Monte Carlo
7. Quantum-Inspired Magnetic Hamiltonian Monte Carlo
8. Shadow Hamiltonian Monte Carlo
9. Seperable Shadow Hamiltonian Monte Carlo
10. Shadow Magnetic Hamiltonian Monte Carlo
11. No-U-Turn Sampler
12. Adaptive Seperable Shadow Hamiltonian Monte Carlo
13. Adaptive Magnetic Hamiltonian Monte Carlo
14. Hamiltonian Monte Carlo with partial momentum refreshment
15. Magnetic Hamiltonian Monte Carlo with partial momentum refreshment
16. Seperable Shadow Hamiltonian Monte Carlo with partial momentum refreshment

The following models are currently in development: 
1. Neal's funnel
2. Banana shaped distribution
3. Bayesian Logistic Regression
4. Bayesian Neural Network
